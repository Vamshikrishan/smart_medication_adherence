# QR-Based Smart Medication Adherence System

## Problem
Medication non-adherence is a major healthcare issue, especially among elderly and chronic patients. Manual tracking and reminders are often ineffective.

## Solution
This project proposes a QR-based digital medication adherence system integrated with pharmacies. Medicine details are entered at the pharmacy, a QR code is generated on the bill, and patients scan it to automatically receive reminders and guidance.

## Key Features
- Pharmacy portal for medicine entry
- QR-based automatic onboarding
- Patient medication reminders
- Adherence tracking

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
